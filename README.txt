Hi there!

How to run the webpage?

Put the "Webpage" in the "www" XAMPP folder, run XAMPP with apache and MySQL, use PhpMyAdmin to store user's data and go to localhost through the browser

Warning: 
This website was originally designed for a 1280x720px display res. but it looks like if you want to see every single part of the webpage at once you should choose
any higher display res. (to keep things simple 1920x1080, I'd also set the upscaling to 125%(geez, I know right, I look forward to make it resizable))



I didn't design this website to be put on internet in a comercial enviroment (you can tell by the images and colors), I just wanted to express myself giving a high
priority to the functionality
Many parts of it will probably change (like descriptions and functions) since this whole thing is full of experimentations (is there such a word), but the overall architecture should stay the same

Thanks for reviewing my work,

see ya
